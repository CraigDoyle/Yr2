/*We want to be sure that we donâ€™t allow double booking of a room. 
Write a new method called isOccupied() which returns a Boolean of True if the room is already 
occupied and False otherwise. 
Demonstrate this in the driver program by trying to set roomB to occupied a second time. 
You should call the setOccupied() method only if the isOccupied() method returns False.*/
