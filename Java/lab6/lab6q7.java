/*Q7. Write a Java application that will teach the user basic multiplication 
(up as far as 12 times tables). Use Math.random() to produce two positive one-digit 
integers. It should then display a question as follows:

How much is 6 times 7 (-1 to quit) ? 43
No, please try again.
How much is 6 times 7 (-1 to quit) ? 42
Very good!
How much is 12 times 12 (-1 to quit) ? 145
No, please try again.
How much is 12 times 12 (-1 to quit) ? -1
Goodbyeâ€¦
